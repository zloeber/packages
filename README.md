## Introduction


Use this repo to easily install releases of popular Open Source apps. We provide a few ways to use it.

1. **Make Based Installer.** This installer works regardless of your OS and distribution. It downloads packages directly from their GitHub source repos and installs them to your `INSTALL_PATH`. 
2. **Alpine Linux Packages.** Use our Alpine repository to install prebuilt packages that use the original source binary (where possible) from the maintainers' official GitHub repo releases.
3. **Docker Image.** Use our docker image as a base-image or as part of a multi-stage docker build. The docker image always distributes the latest linux binaries for `x86_64` architectures.

See examples below for usage.

**Is one of our packages out of date?**

Open up an [issue](https://github.com/cloudposse/packages/issues) or submit a PR (*preferred*). We'll review quickly!

## Usage




### Alpine Repository (recommended)

A public Alpine repository is provided by [Cloud Posse](https://cloudposse.com). The repository is hosted on Amazon S3 and fronted by [CloudFlare's CDN](http://cloudflare.com) with end-to-end TLS. This ensures insane availability with DDoS mitigation and low-cost hosting. Using this alpine repository is ultimately more reliable than depending on [GitHub for availability](https://twitter.com/githubstatus) and provides an easier way to manage dependencies pinned at multiple versions. 

The repository itself is managed using [`alpinist`](https://github.com/cloudposse/alpinist), which takes care of the heavy lifting of building repository indexes. You can self-host your own Alpine repository using this strategy.

### Configure the alpine repository:

#### The Easy Way

We provide a bootstrap script to configure the alpine repository for your version of alpine. 

```
curl -sSL https://apk.cloudposse.com/install.sh | sh
```
__NOTE__: Requires `bash` and `curl` to run:

#### For Docker

Add the following to your `Dockerfile` near the top.
```
# Install the cloudposse alpine repository
ADD https://apk.cloudposse.com/ops@cloudposse.com.rsa.pub /etc/apk/keys/
RUN echo "@cloudposse https://apk.cloudposse.com/3.11/vendor" >> /etc/apk/repositories
```
__NOTE__: we support alpine `3.7`, `3.8`, `3.9`, `3.10`, and `3.11` packages at this time

### Installing Alpine Packages

When adding packages, we recommend using `apk add --update $package` to update the repository index before installing packages.

Simply install any package as normal:
```
apk add gomplate
```

But we recommend that you use version pinning:
```
apk add gomplate==3.0.0-r0
```

And maybe even repository pinning, so you know that you get our versions:
```
apk add gomplate@cloudposse==3.0.0-r0
```

### Makefile Interface

The `Makefile` interface works on OSX and Linux. It's a great way to distribute binaries in an OS-agnostic way which does not depend on a package manager (e.g. no `brew` or `apt-get`). 

This method is ideal for [local development environments](https://docs.cloudposse.com/local-dev-environments/) (which is how we use it) where you need the dependencies installed natively for your OS/architecture, such as installing a package on OSX.

See all available packages:
```
make -C install help
```

Install everything...
```
make -C install all
```

Install specific packages:
```
make -C install aws-vault chamber
```

Install to a specific folder:
```
make -C install aws-vault INSTALL_PATH=/usr/bin
```

Uninstall a specific package
```
make -C uninstall yq
```




## Examples

### Docker Multi-stage Build

Add this to a `Dockerfile` to install packages using a multi-stage build process:
```
FROM cloudposse/packages:latest AS packages

COPY --from=packages /packages/bin/kubectl /usr/local/bin/
```

### Docker with Git Clone

Or... add this to a `Dockerfile` to easily install packages on-demand:
```
RUN git clone --depth=1 -b master https://github.com/cloudposse/packages.git /packages && \
    rm -rf /packages/.git && \
    make -C /packages/install kubectl
```

### Makefile Inclusion

Sometimes it's necessary to install some binary dependencies when building projects. For example, we frequently 
rely on `gomplate` or `helm` to build chart packages.

Here's a stub you can include into a `Makefile` to make it easier to install binary dependencies.

```
export PACKAGES_VERSION ?= master
export PACKAGES_PATH ?= packages/
export INSTALL_PATH ?= $(PACKAGES_PATH)/bin

## Install packages
packages/install:
        @if [ ! -d $(PACKAGES_PATH) ]; then \
          echo "Installing packages $(PACKAGES_VERSION)..."; \
          rm -rf $(PACKAGES_PATH); \
          git clone --depth=1 -b $(PACKAGES_VERSION) https://github.com/cloudposse/packages.git $(PACKAGES_PATH); \
          rm -rf $(PACKAGES_PATH)/.git; \
        fi

## Install package (e.g. helm, helmfile, kubectl)
packages/install/%: packages/install
        @make -C $(PACKAGES_PATH)/install $(subst packages/install/,,$@)

## Uninstall package (e.g. helm, helmfile, kubectl)
packages/uninstall/%:
        @make -C $(PACKAGES_PATH)/uninstall $(subst packages/uninstall/,,$@)
```

### Contributing Additional Packages
In addition to following the Contributing section, the following steps can be used to add new packages for review (via a PR).
1. Clone an existing, similar, package within the vendors directory. Name the new folder with the same name as the binary package being installed.
2. At a minimum, update the `VERSION`, `DESCRIPTION`, and `Makefile` to reflect the binary being installed. Ensure that a test task exist in the package Makefile.
3. Test the install and ensure that it downloads and runs as expected (`make -C install <your_package> INSTALL_PATH=/tmp`)
4. Test the apk build (see below)
5. Update the `README.md` (`make init readme/deps readme`)

### Testing apk builds

To validate that a new package will build into an apk you can use the following steps;

```bash
make docker/build/apk/shell
make -C vendor/<appname> apk
# Some temp build files in the volume mount set user/group to nobody/nobody for apk building.
# It is easier to remove them while within the docker container.
rm -rf ./tmp/build.*
exit
```
